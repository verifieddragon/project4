# CSS110 Project 4
The site consist of 3 pages:
 - Home
 - About
 - Resume
 - When the resume page is opened, an additional button shows up to link to the skills section of the page.

# Home
Home contains the website from project 3. None/minimal edits

# About
Breif biography and resume button

# Resume
Imported resume from project 2. Double header because I didn't want to remove it.

# Challenges
The only challenge I really encountered was an extreme lack of time to work, given all of the assignements I had to work on this week.
As I was finishing up, I noticed that Github paths are not great. When trying to link to a directory above the current one (say /images/file and not images/file), it does not
link because the way it is hosted. In order to get to the root directory you need to add your username, e.i. /username/images/file.

# Enhancements
I think I could improve some small details, and add javascript functionality and it would be a relatively good and functional website.
