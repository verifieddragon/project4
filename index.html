            <h2>What is a Homelab?</h2>
            <p>Many people have different definitions for what a homelab is. In general, a homelab is a self hosted
                platform where you can provide your own services to yourself or others, or have a sandbox environment to
                toy around in to improve your skills.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-item">
            <h2>Why Homelab?</h2>
            <p>Some people create a homelab to develop their skills, while others want to avoid giving their data to
                greedy companies, and maintain their privacy. I homelab so I can host services that I can reliably use
                to host my data or benefit myself without having to pay subscriptions or have my privacy invaded by
                pretty much any company on the known web at this point.</p>

        <div class="flex-item">
            <h2>Hardware</h2>
            <p>My homelab has evolved over time as I learned what I could do. Initially I started out with a refurbished
                Synology DS1515+, since I wanted a NAS. While I had that, I also bought a couple Dell Wyse thin clients
                to mess around hosting Minecraft servers or DNS.
                <br><br>
                Eventually, that NAS started having power issues, so I decided to build my own server after tinkering
                with the Dells. I found an X99 NAS motherboard on Aliexpress which came with a Xeon E5-2680 v4, and 32GB
                of ECC DDR4. I put this board in a 2U chassis I found on amazon that supported the amount of hard drives
                I had.
                <br><br>
                Along with this I also have a standard TP-Link WiFi 6 router and 8-port gigabit switch.
                <br><br>
                Eventually I will turn one of the Dell Wyse thin clients into an offsite backup server, as I don't have
                any redundancy currently as a result of poor planning and me being uninformed. If I had the opportunity
                I would turn my drives into a RAID5/6 array.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-item">
            <h2>Software</h2>
            <p>On the main server, the base operating system I use is Proxmox, which is similar to software you might
                have seen like VirtualBox. Proxmox is a hardware-level virtualization program where you can create
                virtual machines and containers. Essentially, it's like having multiple computers in one device.
                <br><br>
                Inside this Proxmox instance, I host all of my services:
                <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Pi-Hole DNS</li>
                <li>NAS</li>
                <li>Plex</li>

                <li>Remote Access Applications</li>
                <li>Game Servers</li>
                <li>Docker</li>

        <div class="flex-item">
            <h2>Pi-Hole</h2>
            <p>Pi-Hole is a DNS server that blocks ads and trackers. It can be used to block ads on your entire
                network, or just on specific devices. It also has a web interface that allows you to see which
                domains are being blocked and how many requests are being made.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-item">
            <h2>NAS</h2>
            <p>This is a server that runs a NAS OS. I have about 22TB of usable storage that I use as my own
                personal "Google Drive" that I can access with any of my devices. Most of my files remain here with
                only applications or games staying on device storage. Sometimes I even host virtual machine storage
                on this.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-item">
            <h2>Plex</h2>
            <p>Plex is a media server that allows you to stream your media to any device. It can be used to stream
                movies, TV shows, music, and photos. Plex also has a web interface that allows you to manage your
                media and watch it on any device.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-item">
            <h2>Home Assistant</h2>
            <p>Home Assistant is a home automation platform that allows you to control your smart home devices. It
                can be used to control lights, thermostats, cameras, and more. Home Assistant also has a web
                interface that allows you to manage your devices and create automations. I don't have a lot of smart
                devices at this point so I don't frequently use this, but I will later in the future when I can
                afford sensors and devices, and when I have a permanent residence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-item">
            <h2>Remote Access Applications</h2>
            <p>I use a variety of remote access applications to access my homelab from anywhere. Tailscale is used
                as a way to privately access my network from anywhere, essentially like a VPN but without needing to
                port forward. I use Cloudflare to expose some of my services publicly, so that I can access those
                from anywhere without needing a Tailscale connection. This allows me to host web servers for
                example.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-item">
            <h2>AMP</h2>
            <p>I use a program called <a href="https://cubecoders.com/AMP" target="_blank"
                    style="color: rgb(132, 132, 211)">AMP</a> to manage game servers. It is a paid software, but it
                takes a lot of the pain out of manually downloading and configuring the server files, while also
                giving a decent web interface. Currently I host a modded Minecraft server on it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-item">
            <h2>Docker</h2>
            <p>Docker is a container based virtualization program, which allows you to easily start and manage small
                applications that might not need an entire dedicated OS. I run the following applications in Docker:

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h2>Portainer</h2>
                    <p>Portainer is simply a web GUI for Docker, as it does not natively have one. Docker use CLI
                        (Command Line Interface)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h2>Bitwarden (Vaultwarden)</h2>
                    <p>Bitwarden is a self-hosted password manager. Vaultwarden is a more efficient version of the
                        software written is Rust.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h2>NGINX</h2>
                    <p>NGINX is a very popular web server, used on many well known sites such as Netflix, IBM,
                        OpenAI,
                        and many many more.</p>

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h2>Shlink</h2>
                    <p>Many people find it helpful to take a website URL that may be very long and shorten it into
                        something that can easily be shared. You might use a service like Bit.ly to do this. Shlink
                        is a
                        self hosted version of this, allowing you to use your own domain to create shareable custom
                        links.</p>
